# Flutter Composite Design Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Composite design pattern in a Flutter application, showcasing a hierarchical file structure with various media elements. The application calculates and displays the total size of each folder along with its nested elements. Dive into the world of Composite design pattern and Flutter with this exciting example!

## Composite Design Pattern

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures.

### Key Components

1. **IElement Interface**: Defines the common interface for all elements.
2. **Element Class**: Represents the base class for individual elements like audio, image, text, and video.
3. **Folder Class**: Represents the composite class that can contain other elements, enabling a nested hierarchy of elements.
4. **ElementSizeConverter Class**: Handles the conversion of file sizes to human-readable formats.

## Project Structure

The code includes the following key components:

1. **IElement and Element Classes**: Implement the base and leaf components of the Composite pattern.
2. **Folder Class**: Represents the composite class that can contain other elements, implementing the composite pattern's behavior.
3. **ElementSizeConverter Class**: Provides utility functions for converting file sizes to a human-readable format.
4. **CompositeExample Class**: Implements a Flutter application that uses the Composite pattern to display a hierarchical file structure.

## How to Run

To run this example, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RezaEftekhar/composite-Design-pattern-in-flutter.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.
3. Run the application to see the composite design pattern in action.

## Usage

Feel free to use this code as a reference for implementing the Composite design pattern in your own Flutter projects. Modify the code as needed to fit your specific requirements and create fascinating hierarchical representations in your applications.
